# Spelling-corrector-Pulaar
In this notebook, we will implement an auto-correct system using pulaar language. Pulaar is spoken by million people across about 20 countries in West and Central Africa. This notebook is inspired by Peter Norvig who first created auto-correct in 2007 and Deeplearning.ai NLP specialization I took last year. Below the [original article](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) of Peter Norvig.
